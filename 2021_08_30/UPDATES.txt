==================================

This revision INTRODUCES the following functionalities:
* Propagation Modeling
	- Freespace Model path loss calculation capabilities
	- Okumura-Hata Model path loss capabilities
* ArcGIS Integration
	- Fully integrated the SDK for Game Engines released by Esri into a standalone Unreal Engien project
	- SDK does not provide capability of determining where in the world the character is.
	- Using GCS WGS84 -> ECEF conversion to relate character movement to change in coordinates
	- Character movement is now linked to changes in world latitude and longitude
	- Distance between two actors are calculated using the Haversine formula
	- The character location (latitude and longitude) is displayed as character moves
* Digital Elevation Modeling
	- No way to extract terrain height from ArcGIS layers
	- Extract terrain elevation from .hgt files
	- These files have to be placed in the RFPV/Content/HGT_Files folder to be used in the program 
	- Functionality have to be added for user to add future .hgt files.
	- As the character moves, the terrain height at current latitude and longitude is displayed.
