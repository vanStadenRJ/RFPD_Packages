System Boundaries
	- UHF Frequencies (300 - 3000 MHz)
	- Broadcast (Isotropic) Antennas
	- LIMITED to the Western Cape (Manually add HGT Files of other locations) - DEMO
	- Roster Algorithm is functional, but not optimal...	

This revision INTRODUCES the following functionalities:
* Propagation Visualisation
	- Free Space, Okumura-Hata & Longley-Rice Visualisation
	- Utilises the Roster Algorithm
	- Maximum roster dimensions equal to 110 times the chosen resolution
* Signal Strength Prediction
	- Signal strength (dBm) and Path Loss (PL) prediction
	- Accurate to +- 2 dBm when utilising the Longley-Rice model
* User Input
	- Users can easily input various transmitter and propagation parameters
	- Key Inputs:
		P - Displays User Input Screen
		Shift - Visualises current configuration
		W - Moves Globe NORTH
		S - Moves Globe SOUTH
		A - Moves Globe WEST
		D - Moves Globe EAST

ALPHA revision 01   -   2021-08-30
==================================

This revision INTRODUCES the following functionalities:
* Propagation Modeling
	- Freespace Model path loss calculation capabilities
	- Okumura-Hata Model path loss capabilities
* ArcGIS Integration
	- Fully integrated the SDK for Game Engines released by Esri into a standalone Unreal Engien project
	- SDK does not provide capability of determining where in the world the character is.
	- Using GCS WGS84 -> ECEF conversion to relate character movement to change in coordinates
	- Character movement is now linked to changes in world latitude and longitude
	- Distance between two actors are calculated using the Haversine formula
	- The character location (latitude and longitude) is displayed as character moves
* Digital Elevation Modeling
	- No way to extract terrain height from ArcGIS layers
	- Extract terrain elevation from .hgt files
	- These files have to be placed in the RFPV/Content/HGT_Files folder to be used in the program 
	- Functionality have to be added for user to add future .hgt files.
	- As the character moves, the terrain height at current latitude and longitude is displayed.
